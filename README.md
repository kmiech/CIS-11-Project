# CIS-11-Project
CIS-11 Project for Spring 2020
 
 The program included in this file is a Bubble Sort Program. The user can enter any number from 0 to 100 as long as only 8 numbers are inputted by the user. After the numbers are inputted the Bubble sort will sort them based on ascending order. This can come in handy when organizing a group of numbers or test scores.
